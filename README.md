# VADERSentimentAnalysis

This project uses VADER Sentiment Analysis to interpret GenZ and GenAlpha slang. It's a hybrid model that deciphers modern slang by analyzing their inherent sentiment alongside the context they are used in.

**KEY FEATURES:**

**Hybrid Sentiment Model:** Combines VADER with a custom lexicon and context-based analysis.

**Preprocessing Pipeline:** Includes deduplication, standardization, and dataset cleaning.

**Visualization:** Displays sentiment distribution across slang examples.

(This project is a foundational step in my journey to understanding NLP and sentiment analysis. While itâ€™s a basic model, it highlights the idea of combining custom GenZ and GenAlpha lexicons and contextual scoring. The model might not be completely accurate due to the complexity and variability of Gen Z slang, but it provides a good starting point for exploring sentiment analysis in informal contexts, and I plan to extend it with more advanced techniques in the future.)
